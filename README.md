#### IT eBooks database search and downloader. ####

This workflow helps you to search and download IT eBooks from http://it-ebooks.info/, it's easy to use, and really helps people that usually search and ready IT eBooks.

I'm still developing the workflow, soon i'll describe the commands and the documentation for using it.

###### TODO List ######

 - [ ] Permit to configure the behavior, how it 'll search, from where, where to download, how many books to fetch etc
 - [ ] Cache and run requestmultithread for performance, because api just give 10 books per search page
 - [ ] Add documentation and pics in this readme
 - [ ] Search from my own database extracted from the service, and permit custom search like for author, for title
 - [ ] Show the top downloaded ebooks
 - [ ] Show the last updated ebooks
 - [ ] Show the new ebooks
 - [ ] Upload this workflow on packal.org
 - [ ] Add integration with Calibre
